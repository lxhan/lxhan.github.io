Hello, my name is Alex Han. I am a **software engineer**, with experience in web development. Although I work more than 9 years in the IT industry I still consider myself a student. I am very passionate about tech industry in general and always interested in new challenging projects.

It seems to me that over the years I have learned the most important skill for programmers - _the ability to solve problems_, despite the complexity and in what language it is written. However my specialization and field of interest is backend/devops and my favorite programming languages are `Golang` and `TypeScript`.

I am currently working as a backend software engineer at [Crave](https://craveup.com), Seoul.
