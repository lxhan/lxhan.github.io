Hello, my name is Alex Han. I am a **software engineer**, with experience in commercial application and software development. Although I work more than 8 years in the IT industry I still consider myself a student. I am very passionate about tech industry in general and always interested in new challenging projects.

It seems to me that over the years I have learned the most important skill for programmers - _the ability to solve problems_, despite the complexity and in what language it is written. However my specialization and field of interest is `backend/devops`.

~~I am currently working as a backend software engineer at [Crave](https://craveup.com), Seoul.~~\
I am currently looking for a job. Here is my [resume in english](/cv/Resume%20%5BAlex%20Han%5D.pdf) and [resume in korean](/cv/%EC%9D%B4%EB%9F%AD%EC%84%9C%20%5B%ED%95%9C%20%EC%95%8C%EB%A0%89%EC%82%B0%EB%8D%94%5D.pdf).
